# Sudoku_Solver_-CI4O-Group_7

This project implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty levels.

## Introduction

Sudoku is a logic-based combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The goal is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. The project uses a Genetic Algorithm to evolve solutions to these puzzles.

## Features

- Solves Sudoku puzzles using Genetic Algorithm.
- Supports different levels of difficulty: Easy, Medium, and Hard.
- Visualizes the performance of the GA across different puzzle difficulties.
